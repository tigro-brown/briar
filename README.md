# Briar (tigro implementation)
This fork builds off of the briar project and their mesh network messaging app for secure 
communication. The tigro project aims to implement certain features to briar, both in the hope that 
any useful features are considered for implementation into briar, but more so to build off of briar's
phenomenal foundation and test ideas that could be useful for the tigro protocol as a whole.

## Proposed Changes
- Optional notes stored alongside contacts
- Do not share nickname with contacts, must give them a nickname in person
- Secret password to overwrite all data
